# Challenging Conversation App

### UWA - CITS3200

Develop a Conflict Conversation/ Negotiation App that will assist users to prepare for challenging conversations or negotiations and assist them to resolve the conflict or negotiate constructively. A print version of a Conflict Resolution and Negotiation Preparation template is already developed. This could be adapted to allow the user to reflect upon his/her own interests, 'hot buttons', communication style etc and to produce a 'mirror' image of what the other person might be thinking and feeling. It could also include "Tips for Dealing with Emotions", such as breathing cues, reframing text messages, the "90" second rule where users breathe for ninety seconds to relieve emotion etc. The App could also provide links to other useful information in this area. It could also include a brief conflict style survey and provide for themselves and others, FAQs and Help functions.

The App could be used educationally in the Law School's conflict resolution classes but could also be developed commercially.
