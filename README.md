### Front-end (Client) Development

99% of all the code to develop is in the `client/app/main` folder.

There you will find the following folders:
* `templates`: The app's visuals, these include buttons and inputs etc.
* `controllers`: These give the templates functionality!
* `services`: These interact with the database and are injected to controllers.

To start the app (after you have installed the `npm` and `bower` dependencies) type: `gulp watch` in your command line.

### Back-end (Server) Development

The server for the application is hosted and maintained by Google's Firebase.
